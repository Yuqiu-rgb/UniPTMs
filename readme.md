**UniPTMs: The First Unified Multi-type PTM Site Prediction Model via Master-Slave Architecture-Based Multi-Stage Fusion Strategy and Hierarchical Contrastive Loss**

------

Due to the numerous code modules and diverse pre-trained model (PTM) types involved, the code uploaded in Version 1 (current release) may appear somewhat intricate. We are actively refactoring the code to meet reproducibility requirements for research convenience. In Version 2, all weights and embeddings will be comprehensively presented. The weights (OTG PTM) from Version 1 have been uploaded to OneDrive, as detailed in the documentation.

Due to the size limit of GitHub upload file, we have uploaded embedding and weight to onedrive:https://1drv.ms/f/c/f62ed24d5dd739a3/EhfQc9jguN9Buc16HTZQ-LIBiharuqDeyO82gD9ecKZb4A?e=xiAVrB

Model code is stored in "/src" directory

Requirements

	pandas
	
	scikit-learn
	
	transformers
	
	matplotlib
	
	umap-learn

Please download torch version>=2.0 or above to avoid version conflicts

------

To run the code, simply execute train.py

```python
python train.py
```

We will launch the reconstructed V2 version soon!
