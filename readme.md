**UniPTMs: The First Unified Multi-type PTM Site Prediction Model via Master-Slave Architecture-Based Multi-Stage Fusion Strategy and Hierarchical Contrastive Loss**

------

Because the code structure is complex and there are many PTM design categories, the following version is somewhat complex. We are actively reconstructing the V2 version.

Due to the size limit of GitHub upload file, we have uploaded embedding and weight to onedrive:https://1drv.ms/f/c/f62ed24d5dd739a3/EhfQc9jguN9Buc16HTZQ-LIBiharuqDeyO82gD9ecKZb4A?e=xiAVrB

Model code is stored in "/src" directory

Requirements

	pandas
	
	scikit-learn
	
	transformers
	
	matplotlib
	
	umap-learn

Please download torch version>=2.0 or above to avoid version conflicts

------

To run the code, simply execute train.py

```python
python train.py
```

We will launch the reconstructed V2 version soon!
